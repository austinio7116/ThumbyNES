# Vendored sources

## nofrendo/

NES emulation core. Vendored from the **retro-go** project's `retro-core/components/nofrendo` directory.

- Original author: Matthew Conte (1998-2000), with contributions from Neil Stevens and the retro-go maintainers.

We may make local modifications under `vendor/nofrendo/` to (a) remove the
retro-go OSD coupling (`rg_*` calls, `MESSAGE_INFO` macros), (b) replace
`FILE*` ROM/save loading with in-memory buffers so we can mmap from XIP
flash, and (c) tag hot functions with `__not_in_flash_func` for the device
build. Any such patches are listed below as they happen.
